  ### Advantages of the Gastric Sleeve Surgery
  * Less risk of nutritional deficiencies compared to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
  * A good choice for patients with BMI over 50, and usually can be laparoscopic
  * Can be safer if you normally take anti-inflammatory medications for other conditions
  * Over 80% of type II diabetes cases are resolved
  * Hypertension is improved or resolved in many patients
  * A great deal of excess weight is lost rapidly, and patients experience resolution of co-morbidities, and improved appearance.
  * As with every type of bariatric surgery, the overall quality of life for patients improves greatly.

  ### Weight Loss and the Vertical Gastric Sleeve (VSG)
  * The VSG is a top choice for morbidly obese (BMI over 40) and super-obese (BMI over 50) patients
  * 47% Excess Weight Loss (EWL) after 12 months and 63 to 70% EWL at three years post-surgery
  * About 50% EWL in one year, or a BMI loss of 12 points among patients whose starting BMI averaged 44. 4
  * Long-term weight loss results appear promising: super-obese patients in one study had an average of 46% EWL after 8 years

  ### Weight Loss and the Vertical Gastric Sleeve (VSG)
  * The Gastric Sleeve is restrictive and it affects your appetite hormones
  * Restrictive: The small sleeve fills up quickly when you eat so that your brain is faster to recognize that you’ve eaten enough
  * Hormonal: Changes some of the hormones that affect your hunger and satiety

In vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), your stomach size is reduced to 15 percent of the original size to help you lose weight and feel full after eating smaller amounts of food. The surgeon removes 80 to 85 percent of your stomach. Then he uses the remaining portion of your stomach to make a tube-shaped sleeve that goes from the esophagus to your small intestine. After the procedure, the size of your sleeve is only 15 to 20 percent of the original size of your stomach. Finally, the surgeon staples closed the sleeve in your stomach and uses a sealant to prevent leaks.
