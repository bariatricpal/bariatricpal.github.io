    the skin ​​and fat, and the fluctuations in body weight through the years, all
    of ​​these factors contribute to a gradual loss of volume and ptosis of the ​​breast.
    The correction of this breast ptosis is done with a surgery that ​​replaces the
    breast to its normal site, and it can even be done with ​​breast implants to not
    only correct the fall of the breast, but also give it a ​​more youthful look."

A **breast lift**, also known as mastopexy, raises the breasts by removing excess skin and tightening the surrounding tissue to reshape and support the new breast contour. Breast surgery procedures must be tailored to each individual. **Breast augmentation with implants consists in placing** an implant behind the mammary gland and/or the pectoral muscle.

**Breast reduction** is for when sometimes a bigger breast size is not wanted, and for that a breast reduction is needed. It can be due to a previous breast augmentation that you now feel uncomfortable with, or just your regular breast size being too large for you. From breast augmentation to breast lift and breast reduction, let us guide you to make an informed decision what procedure is right for you.
