- question: How does a doctor become Board Certified?
  answer: |-
    By choosing a plastic surgeon who is board certified by The Mexican Board of Plastic, Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery, you can be assured that the doctor has graduated from an accredited medical school and has completed at least five years of additional training as a resident surgeon in a program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Medical Education. This includes a minimum of five years of residency training in all areas of surgery, including at least two years devoted entirely to plastic surgery. Certification is a voluntary process a surgeon seeks after this training. To become certified, the doctor then must pass comprehensive written and oral exams.

    We suggest you visit the link Consejo Mexicano de Cirugía Plástica, Estética y Reconstructiva, A.C. and click on “Especialistas Certificados” to check whether a doctor is board certified by Mexican Board of Plastic, Aesthetic and Reconstructive Surgery.

- question: Is Board Certification in Plastic Surgery the Best?
  answer: |-
    Good plastic surgeon qualifications that you need to consider and important information that should be available to you:

    * Is the doctor Board Certified and is that specialty area appropriate to the procedure you are considering?
    * What qualifications/training does the physician have to perform the procedure in question?
    * How many of this type of procedure has he/she performed?
    * How many of this type of procedure does he/she perform each year?
    * If you are considering a new procedure, how did the doctor obtain training for this?
    * Has the doctor had many problems or complications with this procedure?
    * Do you feel comfortable with that doctor?
    * Am I a good candidate for plastic surgery?

    The best candidate for plastic surgery is an individual in good general health who has reasonable expectations about his or her appearance. During your initial consultation, it is extremely important to be honest while discussing your goals and concerns so the surgeon can make an informed, realistic assessment about your candidacy for plastic surgery.
- question: Is plastic surgery safe?
  answer: All surgical procedures involve risk. Selecting a qualified surgeon is the
    best way to reduce your chance of experiencing a complication. It is also important
    to follow all of your doctor’s pre- and post- operative instructions carefully
    to be sure that you are prepared for surgery and that your body is appropriately
    cared for after your procedure.
- question: How much pain, recovery time, and scarring should I expect?
  answer: Every individual is different, and individual responses to plastic surgery
    may vary. Your doctor can advise you of how much pain to expect and provide you
    with medication to minimize discomfort. Your doctor can also inform you about
    reasonable expectations for recovery time and scarring concerns for your procedure
    type during your consultation.
- question: Are there any products or behaviors I should limit to prepare for surgery?
  answer: |-
    To prepare for surgery, please observe the following guidelines on both the day before and day of your surgery:

    * It is important that you do not eat or drink anything after midnight on the day prior to surgery.
    * You should shower with an antibacterial soap (e.g. Dial, Phisoderm), the day before surgery as well as the day of surgery, but avoid scrubbing areas that have been marked for your procedure.
    * Do not shave the surgical area or apply moisturizing lotion.
    * Wear minimal makeup to the hospital.
    * Wear loose fitting, button-front clothing. Leave jewelry and other valuables at home.
    * Arrive at the hospital one hour prior to your scheduled surgery time.
- question: What should I expect immediately after surgery?
  answer: After your surgery is complete, you will remain in the recovery room for
    approximately one hour before being transferred to the post surgical care area.
    If you are an outpatient, you will be discharged by the nurses when your condition
    is stable, usually about two to four hours after your procedure is completed.
    You must be accompanied by someone who can drive you home and you will also need
    assistance at home for the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery. Limit you activities
    for the first 24 hours and begin taking the pain medications and antibiotics prescribed
    during your pre-operative appointment. Be sure to contact the doctor if you have
    any unusual symptoms or other concerns.
- question: When can I resume my normal activities?
  answer: |-
    **Eating:** It is not unusual to not feel very hungry after surgery, but it is best to take your medications with something in your stomach. Small amounts of clear, non-carbonated liquids and bland foods may be tolerated better after anesthesia. You may continue to adjust your diet after surgery as you feel comfortable.

    **Driving:** You should avoid driving for at least one week following your procedure and you should never drive while taking pain medication or if pain limits your ability to move quickly. You will need someone to drive you on the day of surgery as well as the day of your first follow-up appointment.

    **Showering:** If you have been instructed to leave your bandages in place you may only sponge bathe until your doctor removes the dressings. Do not take a bath if you have drains in place, and use only luke warm water for your first few showers after surgery. Make sure someone else is nearby to assist you if you feel lightheaded, and face away from the shower and allow the water to run over your shoulders. Your doctor can inform you when it is appropriate to resume showering normally.

    **Exercising/ Lifting** After surgery, you will be unable to exercise or perform heavy lifting for four to six weeks. You should restrict your activity to avoid prolonged swelling that can stretch the skin and avoid lifting objects over your head. Also, changes in blood pressure associated with exercise or strenuous activity can cause bleeding problems.
- question: What warning signs should I watch for in the days and weeks following
    surgery?
  answer: |-
    The following symptoms may indicate possible warning signs. Alert your doctor immediately if you develop any of the following:

    * Sudden increased pain in the area of surgery
    * Sudden persistent swelling at the surgical site
    * Numbness in any extremity
    * Fever greater than 101.5 degrees
    * Redness of incision or surgical area
    * Wound separation
    * Drainage or bleeding from the incision
    * Swelling or pain in the calf
    * Persistent nausea or vomiting
    * Inability to urinate after surgery
    * Any other unusual symptoms that concern you

    will meet Dr. Galvez, if you have any questions feel free to contact us.

  answer: You can have surgery if you’re underage. However, both of your parents have
    to be with you the day of surgery and both of them need to sign the consentment
    forms.
