A neck lift, or lower rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure that treats:

* Excess fat and skin relaxation in the lower face that creates jowls
* Excess fatty deposits under the chin
* Loose neck skin
* Muscle banding in the neck, which created abnormal contours

Weight fluctuations, gravity and time, are all reflected in our face as we age, causing loose skin and hypertrophy of spaces in zones of the face. The **face lift** restores the natural vectors of the skin to bring it a more youthful look. There are many types and variations for this procedure. Schedule a consultation to see if you are a candidate for a face lift.

With age there is a natural depletion of fat and volume in zones of the face. Facial fat grafting uses your own fat to restore volume in specific parts. It is very regularly done in combination with face lifts or on its own for some patients. Ask if you're a candidate for this procedure and about the added benefits of fat graft.

**Blepharoplasty** addresses problems with excess skin in the upper eye lid or excess skin and/or fat herniation in the lower eye lid. Getting rid of these conditions restores the eyes from a tired appearance to a more rested and open one.

**Bichat fat pads** are two small fat deposits that normally weight 8-10 grams, and they rest in the transition from the cheek bone to the cheek. **Bichat fat pads removal** gives the benefit of accentuating that transition by removing it, and in some patients giving them a thinner looking profile.

### Non-surgical procedures

**Botox** — In facial rejuvenation, prevention is key, and there is no better option than Botox in preventing and reducing expression lines or wrinkles in some zones of the face. Many falsely believe that Botox will leave their face without expression, but this was only seen many years ago due to overuse or overcorrection. Schedule a consultation to learn if you can take some years off the clock with a more rested and youthful look.

**Hyaluronic acid fillers** — Hyaluronic acid is a naturally-occurring substance in the body and has many applications in cosmetic medicine. It is mainly used as a filler for deep wrinkles and creases and also in restoring volume or disguising small concavities in the face. It can be used for lip augmentation, liquid nose job or rhinoplasty, and liquid face lift. Its effect is temporary, so many patients start with a filler before moving up to fat grafts or even a surgery.
