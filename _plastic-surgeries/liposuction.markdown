**Liposuction**, also called lipoplasty or lipo, is a type of cosmetic surgery that breaks up and "sucks" fat from the body. Most commonly, liposuction is used on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, neck, chin, upper and backs of the arms, and back. This procedure consists of using small cannulas to extract fat from the body. It’s also known as body contouring or liposculpture, because we use the natural curves of the body to highlight its convexities and concavities to achieve a more curvaceous or voluptuous female contour. Liposuction is usually combined with fat grafting to hips and butt, also known as a Brazilian butt lift.

**Abdominal edging**, is a variation of high definition liposuction that focuses on highlighting the edges of the abdominal muscles. This is very popular in patients who are near their normal body
