          It is understandable to be nervous about having a medical procedure done in a foreign country, but what if you could be sure the hospital and medical staff were on par with, or better than, the best American hospitals? BariatricPal Hospital MX is unique.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among all of the American companies offering weight loss surgery packages to Mexico, BariatricPal is the only one with our own hospital. This means:
        </p>
        <ul class='unorderedList'>
          <li class='unorderedList-item'>
            American standards for facility quality and medical standards.
          </li>
          <li class='unorderedList-item'>
            Hand-picked surgeons and medical staff – only the best make our cut.
          </li>
          <li class='unorderedList-item'>
            Even lower prices because we own the hospital and do not have to pay for you to use it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our hospital is built to offer the top-notch care you would hope for in the U.S., with leading bariatric professionals ready to provide a first-rate experience. In fact, you could say that the only thing “foreign” about BariatricPal Hospital MX are the low prices.
