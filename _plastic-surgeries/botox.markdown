Botox is one of the most popular treatments for aging, wrinkled skin. Botox, a form of botulinum toxin, is commonly used on horizontal forehead furrows, vertical lines between the eyebrows and “crow’s feet” around the eyes. Because it is non-surgical and very effective, many aging adults turn to Botox to improve their appearance and alleviate signs of aging.
