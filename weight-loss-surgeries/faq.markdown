  description: Frequently Asked Questions about Weight Loss Surgery in Mexico at BariatricPal
    Hospital MX
faqs:
- question: Why would I consider weight loss surgery in Mexico?
  answer: Getting your surgery done in Mexico can be less expensive than getting it
    in the U.S. if you are paying out of pocket. Weight loss surgery can be tens of
    thousands of dollars in the U.S., not including follow-up care such as nutritional
    support. You can get your surgery, including pre-op testing, accommodations, and
    two years of follow-up nutritional support, done with BariatricPal Hospital MX
    for a fraction of the cost. Even if your insurance covers weight loss surgery,
    you might choose surgery in Mexico because the final cost to you is lower. For
    example, your co-pay in the U.S. could be high, or your insurance policy may not
    cover the specific type of bariatric surgery you want. Or, your health insurance
    policy may have a one-bariatric-surgery-per-lifetime limit, and you may need a
    revision.
- question: Which surgeries and other procedures are offered through BariatricPal
    Hospital MX?
  answer: "We know each patient has individual needs and preferences that affect the\nbest
    choice of weight loss surgeries for him or her. We offer the\nfollowing bariatric
    surgeries:\n\n* Gastric Sleeve or Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy\n* Roux-en-Y Gastric

    Breast Lifts\n* Lipo\n* Arm Lift\n* Thigh Lift\n* Botox\n* + Many more "
- question: Who is eligible for weight loss surgery?
  answer: |-
    We believe bariatric surgery is an obesity treatment option that should be
    accessible for everyone who might benefit from it. For that reason, you
    are eligible for our program if you meet the criteria for weight loss
    surgery and you agree to our requirements. **These are standard criteria for weight loss surgery eligibility:**

    * BMI over 40 or over 100 lbs. overweight or BMI over 35 plus one or more obesity-related comorbidities such as heart disease or diabetes.
    * History of failed serious diet attempts.

- question: What does the surgery package fee include?
  answer: |-
    **We consider the surgery package fee all-inclusive. It includes the
    following:**

    * Round trip transportation to and from the San Diego airport.
    * The hospital stay (two nights) and fees for surgery
    * Routine pre-op and post-op testing and evaluations
    * Routine post-op prescription medications (not included in pricing for Dr. Ponce).
    * Two nights of post-op recovery, including gourmet recovery broth
    * Accommodations for a travel companion during your stay.

    Our package prices may seem low, but there are no hidden fees! We are able
    to keep our costs down by negotiating group rates, and we pass the savings on to you.
- question: Does my deposit go towards the total package fee?
  answer: Yes. The remaining balance is due 48 hours prior to surgery date.
- question: How do I pay the remaining balance of my surgery package?
  answer: The best option is to directly deposit your payment into our Wells Fargo
    bank account because there is no additional fee. You can PayPal or pay with a
    major credit card and pay an additional 3% service charge. We also accept checks
    by phone.
- question: How do transportation and lodging work with BariatricPal Hospital MX in
    Mexico?
  answer: |-
    You are responsible for making your own arrangements to get to the San
    Diego Airport. Please contact us before making your reservations to ensure
    we can pick you up at the scheduled time.

    You will be picked up at the airport by one of our friendly English
    speaking drivers. You may need to phone for the pick-up. Then you will be
    taken across the border and either directly to the hospital, if your
    surgery is same-day, or to the hotel if your surgery is next-day.
- question: How much money should I bring on the trip? Should I bring cash?
  answer: |-
    Some cash for minor expenses such as tips and food is advisable, but we
    suggest do not bring too much. There are ATM machines throughout the city,
    and most major credit cards are accepted nearly everywhere, so do not
    worry if you have any unexpected expenses. Just remember to let your bank
    know that you will be out of the country so that you do not experience any
    inconveniences with your cards. Currency exchange rates fluctuate on a
    daily basis, so you can check what the rate is just before your arrival so
    you know what to expect. Canadian dollars are not accepted in Mexico. Tips
    are welcome!
- question: What additional costs and fees are there?
  answer: 'Any food or drink outside of the hospital is not covered in the patient
    package. '
- question: Can anyone accompany me?
  answer: |-
    Yes. One travel/support companion is included in the package deal.
    Additional fees will apply if you are traveling with more than one
    companion or you choose to stay longer than the two nights included in the
    package deal.
- question: How many days should I expect to be in Mexico?
  answer: Barring no medical complications, if you arrive the day of your surgery
    it will be for a period of three nights (two nights in the hospital and one night
    in the hotel) and depart on the fourth day. If you decide to fly in the day before
    your surgery, then you would leave on the fifth day
- question: What should I bring on my trip?
  answer: Since it is a relatively brief stay and the fact that you will be in a hospital
    gown for more than 50% of the time that you are here, we suggest you travel light.
    A carry-on bag or light piece of luggage should suffice. Keep in mind you will
    not be able to lift heavy objects after your surgery, so a light bag with wheels
    may be best. Bring comfortable shoes, loose items of clothing, and your personal
    toiletry kits. Laptops or Ipad/tablets are more than welcome for you to use with
    the free wi-fi service provided at both the hospital and the hotel. PLEASE CHECK
    OUR LIST OF ITEMS TO BRING WITH YOU BELOW.
- question: Are my personal belongings safe?
  answer: For those of you that are traveling without a companion, rest assured that
    all of your personal belongings will be right where you left them when you are
    returned to your hospital room after surgery. As a general security measure, we
    suggest leaving valuables such as jewelry at home. You will not be needing them
    in the hospital!
- question: How should I plan my flights to and from San Diego?
  answer: |-
    We understand that sometimes your travel plans are out of your hands or
    that you would like to book the most cost-efficient flight available.
    However, you must also take into consideration that our transportation
    service is not at our disposal as a 24 hour service. Therefore any flight
    arriving after 7:00 p.m. or departing before 10:00 a.m. makes the ride to the
    airport to be considered as being done during “non-business” hours of
    operation, and a additional pick up fee of $50.00 will be added.

    For logistical reasons, if you are arriving the day of your surgery, we
    ask that you please arrive between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. PST no later.
    This will ensure that your surgery will be performed that same day.

    For logistical reasons, we ask that you book your departing flights from
    San Diego after 1:00 p.m. PST so that we can get you across the border
    and to the airport with plenty of time to spare. We cannot be responsible
    for missed flights due to slow border crossings. We highly recommend you
    contact us before booking your flight!
- question: What type of identification do I need?
  answer: Remember that you are traveling across international borders. You must bring
    a government-issued passport or passport card. This will help expedite the ride
    back across the border to the airport.
- question: What if I do not have a passport?
  answer: All persons entering Mexico MUST have a valid passport or passport card.
    BE SURE TO CHECK OUR INFORMATION ON PASSPORTS AND CUSTOMS FOR US AND NON US CITIZENS
- question: How long does the surgery last and how soon will I be awake, up and about?
  answer: The surgical procedure lasts anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour. Afterwards,
    you will stay in post-op recovery for about 2 to 3 hours until the anesthesia
    wears off and you regain feeling in your legs. Afterwards, you will be taken back
    to your hospital room. You will be up and walking in 6 to 8 hours after surgery.
- question: What pain levels and side effects may I might encounter?
  answer: Every person has a different threshold for pain, so it is difficult to say
    how much pain and discomfort you will go through. Rest assured that the hospital
    staff will be there to assist you at any time. You will be given pain medications
    as needed. One possible, but not common, side effect is nausea due to the anesthesia.
- question: Will I still be connected to a drain after I’m discharged from the hospital?
  answer: Absolutely not. Before you are discharged from the hospital, your IV and
    drain will be removed and you will be given an additional test to insure that
    there are no leaks involved with your procedure. You will receive instructions
    on safe recovery activities and restrictions.
- question: What about jewelry and piercings?
  answer: All jewelry and piercings must be removed during surgery. No exceptions.
- question: Why must I go on a pre-op diet?
  answer: The main reason is to reduce the fatty tissue around your liver and this,
    in turn, will also help reduce both the surgery time and in the healing process
    as well. The pre-op diet is a liquid diet that will also help prepare you for
    the first stage of the post-op diet.
- question: Will I have a special diet after surgery?
  answer: Yes. A special diet with careful instructions will be given to you by the
    surgeon. You will also meet with a BariatricPal Hospital MX nutritionist for instructions
    on your diet after surgery.
- question: Will I have noticeable scars after surgery?
  answer: Your incisions will be approximately one inch in length and barely noticeable
    as time passes.
- question: Is it safe to travel to Tijuana, Mexico for surgery?
  answer: It is completely safe to travel to Tijuana, Mexico and have surgery with
    us, at BariatricPal Hospital MX. Our team takes care of you from your arrival
    at the San Diego Airport through the entire weight loss surgery experience. Someone
    is always available to answer your questions, address your concerns and explain
    what to expect.
- question: Mexico's standards are not up to par with U.S. standards. Is that true?
  answer: Our standards are world class! Our surgeons and hospitals go through rigorous
    reviews to assure that internationals standards are met.
- question: Are the facilities clean and modern like those in the U.S.?
  answer: BariatricPal Hospital MX is a modern and state-of-the-art. Our hospital
    maintain the highest standards of cleanliness and efficiency. Most patients mention
    that our hospital is much cleaner than those they visit in their hometown.
- question: What bougie size does the doctor use?
  answer: Dr. Illan uses a 32 Fr bougie for the gastric sleeve procedure. This is
    the bougie size that has the best results without having complications such as
    strictures.
- question: Do you use stitches to close up the incisions?
  answer: Our surgeons use an absorbable suture called Monocryl. So no stitches need
    to be removed. Your small wounds will be covered with bandages. You will be able
    to shower with regular soap and water. You will not be able to submerge in a bathtub,
    hot-tub or a swimming pool for a couple of weeks.
- question: Can I drink alcohol?
  answer: Yes, but it is not recommended. Alcohol has many calories and will not help
    on your progress with your weight loss. Alcohol intoxication will also hit you
    a lot faster with the VSG than other surgeries.
- question: How does Smoking affect my surgery?
  answer: Smoking hinders the healing process.
- question: How much time off work?
  answer: After your bariatric procedure you should able to resume your regular activity
    once you get home. Some people who have desk-jobs return to work within 5 to 7
    days. We do restrict our patients on “heavy” weight lifting for 30 days.
- question: What kind of staples do you use? Will they sound off the alarm if I cross
    the metal detector in an Airport?
  answer: Our surgeons use titanium staples made by Echelon in the United States.
    Our surgeons also over sew the staple line making our leakage rate very low.
- question: How about leaks?
  answer: Our surgeon’s leakage rate is at 0.32%. You will have 2 leak tests performed
    in the operating room after the sleeve is completed, a blue dye and an air test
    while you are still under anesthesia. The last leak test that is performed is
    a barium swallow.

- title: Passport and US Customs Requirements
  faqs:
  - question: What travel documents and identification are required for a foreign
      national to enter the U.S.?
    answer: |-
      A foreign national or alien entering the U.S. is generally required to
      present a passport and valid visa issued by a U.S. Consular Official,
      unless they are a citizen of a country eligible for the Visa Waiver
      Program, or are a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. or a citizen of
      Canada. The Visa Waiver Program allows foreign nationals from certain
      countries to be admitted to the U.S. under limited conditions and for a
      limited time without obtaining a visa.

      The foreign national must arrive on an approved carrier (if coming by air
      or sea), staying no more than 90 days, for pleasure/medical purposes
      business, and be able to prove they are not inadmissible. The foreign
      national is still required to have a passport. To obtain a list of
      countries eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, please reference the
      Department of State Web site. For VWP passport requirements, see
      VWP-eligible passport.

      **NOTE**: All travelers transiting the United States are subject to the
      U.S. customs/immigration laws

      Canadians coming as a Treaty Trader, classification E are required to have
      a visa to enter the U.S. as are Canadians coming to marry a U.S. citizen
      and reside in the U.S. (K1).

      A visa and passport are not required of a Mexican national who is in
      possession of a Form DSP-150, B-1/B-2 Visa and Border Crossing Card*,
      containing a machine-readable biometric identifier, issued by the
      Department of State and is applying for admission as a temporary visitor
      for business or pleasure from contiguous territory by land or sea. Mexican
      citizens using the Border Crossing Card may travel 55 miles into the U.S. -
      except in the Nogales/Tucson area, where travel to Tucson is authorized.

      The Border Crossing Card (BCC) is acceptable as a stand-alone document (by
      itself) only for travel from Mexico by land, or by pleasure vessel or
      ferry. Together with a valid passport, though, it meets the documentary
      requirements for entry at all land, air, and sea ports of entry (to
      include travel from Canada). Note: You must be a Mexican citizen and a
      resident of Mexico to have a BCC.

      Continuing students who are going to travel outside of the United States
      must see their foreign student advisor and obtain an endorsement from the
      DSO or RO. The endorsement will be made on page 3 of the SEVIS Form I-20
      or page 1 of the DS-2019. When returning to the United States, a
      continuing student/exchange visitor must present a valid SEVIS Form I-20
      or DS-2019 with the DSO or RO signature showing that the student is active
      and in good standing with the school or program.

      Visitors traveling to the U.S. are required to be in possession of
      passports that are valid for six months beyond the period of their
      intended stay in the U.S. See list of countries exempt from the six month
      requirement Visiting the U.S. - Documents required for Canadian Citizens /
      Residents / Landed Immigrant to enter the U.S. and how long they can stay.
  - question: Documents required by Canadian Citizens / Residents / Landed Immigrants
      to enter the U.S. and how long can they stay?
    answer: |-
      Canadian Citizens’ passports are NOT required to be valid for six months past their intended date of departure. Their passports must only be valid up until the date of their intended departure. All Canadian Citizens entering the United States by AIR are required to present a valid passport, or a NEXUS card when departing from a designated Canadian airport.

      **By Land and Sea (including ferries):**

      Canadian citizens traveling to the U.S. by land or sea are required to
      present one of the travel documents listed below, and may generally visit the U.S. for up to six months. CBP will accept Canadian passport,
      Enhanced Driver’s License/Enhanced Identification Card, NEXUS, FAST/EXPRES and SENTRI enrollment cards.

      **Children:**

      Canadian citizens 15 years old and younger arriving by land or sea from contiguous territory may present an original or copy of his or her birth certificate or a Canadian Citizenship Card. Canadian Citizens 16 and older must have a valid passport unless traveling as part of an organized group described below.

      **Groups of Children:**

      Canadian citizen children under age 19 arriving by land or sea from
      contiguous territory and traveling with a school group, religious group, social/cultural organization, or sports team, may also present an original or copy of his or her birth certificate, a Consular Report of Birth Abroad, a Naturalization Certificate, or a Canadian Citizenship Card.

      The group should provide, on organizational letterhead: The name of the group and supervising adult, a list of the children on the trip, the
      primary home address, phone number, date of birth, place of birth, and name of at least one parent or legal guardian for each child. A written and signed statement of the supervising adult certifying that he or she has obtained parental or legal guardian consent for each participating child. Canadians coming as a Treaty Trader (and family), Fiancés/Fiancées (and their children and spouses and children) of U.S. Legal permanent residents are required to have a visa to enter the U.S.

      Residents (PR) of Canada who are landed immigrants generally need a
      passport and visa to enter the United States, unless they are a citizen of a country eligible for the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). If they are a
      citizen of a country eligible for the VWP, they are only required to have
      their valid passport - coming by land or sea. If coming by air, they will
      need to have advance approval to travel through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA). There is an ESTA application fee of $14. To obtain a list of countries eligible for the VWP, please reference the Department of State Web site.

      Also, Native American Indians born in Canada with at least 50% American Indian blood are exempt from having a visa and passport to enter the U.S. by land. They should have their tribal identity card to present to the CBP Officer. If an American Indian is arriving into the U.S. by AIR, the traveler will be required to have a passport.

      The burden of proof that the Canadian citizen is not an intended immigrant (plans to make the U.S. their primary residence) is always on the applicant. There is no set period of time Canadians must wait to reenter the U.S. after the end of their stay, but if it appears to the CBP Officer that the person applying for entry is spending more time overall in the U.S. than in Canada, it will be up to the traveler to prove to the officer that they are not de-facto U.S. residents. One of the ways to do this demonstrates significant ties to their home country, including proof of employment, residency, etc.
  - question: What documents, identification, and paperwork does a U.S. citizen need
      to travel internationally?
