An **arm lift**, or brachioplasty, is a surgical procedure that:

* Reduces excess sagging skin that droops downward
* Tightens and smooths the underlying supportive tissue that defines the shape of the upper arm
* Reduces localized pockets of fat in the upper arm region

This procedure's main goal is removing the excess skin in the underarm. After weight loss, excess skin in the arms is not only removed for aesthetic purposes, it also becomes very uncomfortable for patients. There are various techniques of arm lifts. Schedule a consultation to learn what would be the best approach for you.
