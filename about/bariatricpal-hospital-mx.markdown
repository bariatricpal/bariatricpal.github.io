          Our team knows that your choice of weight loss surgery types is individual. That is why we offer a range of surgery types.

          We do not push one type of weight loss surgery on a patient just because it is a popular type or it is our surgeon’s preferred type. The type of weight loss surgery you get is a careful decision made by you and your surgeon based on your preferences, goals, lifestyle, and health risks.
