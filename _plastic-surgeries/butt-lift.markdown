**Brazilian butt lift (BBL)**

Butt augmentation is one of the most sought out procedures, and the Brazilian butt lift offers both the benefit of body contouring liposuction and butt augmentation through fat grafting, resulting in drastic results and changes you will see and love.

Not everyone is candidate for a BBL, but that doesn’t mean you can't have a butt augmentation with implants. For these patients, there is the option of using implants to achieve a rounder, bigger shape.
