  ### Advantages of the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass
  * No bands, staples or other foreign objects in your body
  * An established procedure with more research on safety and effectiveness than other procedures
  * More weight loss in the first year than the gastric sleeve and the adjustable gastric band (lap-band)
  * Reversible if necessary (but not easily)
  * Can be revised to a longer-limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass if an initial short-limb procedure does not lead to expected weight loss.
  * Quick improvements in your health, especially in your blood sugar control with better insulin resistance, lower blood sugar levels and possible resolution of diabetes.
  * May be a good choice for individuals with a sweet tooth because sweet foods are not typically tolerated.

  ### Weight Loss and the Roux-en-Y (RYGB)
  * Rapid weight loss in first 6 to 12 months
  * About 65 to 70% of excess weight loss (EWL) within 2 years
  * Often more than 100 pounds lost
  * The RYGB is restrictive and malapsorptive and it affects your appetite hormones

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is the second most common type of gastric bypass weight loss surgery performed today. It is usually laparoscopic. It is reversible if necessary, but is designed to be permanent. BariatricPal ospital MX’s surgeons are recognized experts in Laproscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery. They’ve performed thousands of Gastric Bypass procedures with the lowest complication rates in Mexico and zero fatalities. You will not find a more experienced Gastric Bypass surgical team - anywhere!

In the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) procedure, the surgeon first divides your stomach, leaving a smaller upper portion and stitching shut the larger remainder of your stomach so that it can’t be used anymore. Normally, food in your stomach empties to the upper portion of the small intestine. In RYGB, the surgeon attaches the small stomach pouch to a place lower down on the small intestine, thus “bypassing” the majority of your stomach, the duodenum (upper portion of your small intestine) and at least part of the jejunum (middle portion of your small intestine).

A long-limb RYGB procedure bypasses more of your intestine; in this case, the surgeon attaches your newly formed small stomach pouch to a place even lower on your small intestine. The long-limbed RYGB procedure can lead to faster weight loss because of greater nutrient malabsorption (fewer nutrients absorbed). Why is the procedure called “Roux-en-Y?” The gastric pouch is called the “roux limb,” and the “Y” shape is formed by the three arms coming together at a junction. The three parts are:

* The small stomach pouch that holds food
* The large stomach pouch that secretes digestive juices
* The far portion of the small intestine that the two portions of the stomach are connected to
