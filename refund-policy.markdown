            There is a 50% administrative fee ($250.00 USD) on your deposit for cancellation of your surgery. If you have paid your surgery in full and cancel, you will be refunded your payments, minus the 50% administrative fee on your deposit ($250.00 USD).
          </p>
          <p>
            For any cancellation 6 days prior, or on the day of surgery, there is an administrative fee of 50% on the full amount paid for the surgery. If you wish to reschedule your surgery for a later date, you can use the administrative fee as part of your payment. Your surgery price will be honored for up to a year from your initial deposit.
