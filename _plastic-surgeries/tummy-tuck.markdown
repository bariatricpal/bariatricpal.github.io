**Tummy tuck surgery**, also known as abdominoplasty, removes excess fat and skin and, in most cases, restores weakened or separated muscles creating an abdominal profile that is smoother and firmer. This surgery removes the excess skin and fat of the lower abdomen while at the same time tightening the abdominal muscles to create a flatter more aesthetic tummy. Usually patients who have had a pregnancy or have lost a significant amount of weigh are perfect candidates for this procedure.  There are different types of tummy tuck depending on your body type.

Sometimes the excess skin is mostly located in the front and sides of the abdomen, and very little in the back. A normal or a circumferential tummy tuck would not get rid of all of this skin. For these patients, there is the **Fleur de lis tummy tuck**. Its main difference is that it’s a vertical mid line resection combined with the horizontal resection. This procedure is mostly done combined with a regular, extended or circumferential tummy tuck.

**Lower body lift/360 tummy tuck/Belt lipectomy/circumferential tummy tuck is mostly done for patients** who have lost an important amount of weight, and have been left with an excessive amount of skin in their abdomen and back. It consists of removing all excess skin and tightening the abdominal muscles while restoring contour. It's also known as a lower body lift, because through this procedure we can lift to some extent, outer hips, butt and thighs.

Excess skin after weight loss is no stranger to the back. For this, there is always the option of a torspolasty to get rid of excess skin on the mid and upper back. There are different types of **torsoplasty**; talk to your plastic surgeon about the options to determine what works better for you.

An **upper body lift is a combination** of an arm lift, breast lift (with or without implants) and in some patients a torsoplasty. It addresses the full upper body in one surgery. A Mommy Makeover is our most popular procedure. It is a combination of liposuction, Brazilian butt lift, tummy tuck and breast augmentation, lift or breast reduction. All work together to give you a drastic change that will not only help you recover your pre-pregnancy body, but it will make you look better than ever.
